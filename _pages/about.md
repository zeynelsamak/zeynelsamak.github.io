I am a last year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Bristol and a member of [Visual Information Laboratory](https://vilab.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/){:target="\_blank"}. I'm supervised by [Prof Majid Mirmehdi](http://people.cs.bris.ac.uk/~majid//){:target="\_blank"} and [Dr Philip Clatworthy](http://www.bris.ac.uk/clinical-sciences/people/231094/overview.html){:target="\_blank"}. I am interested in the machine (deep) learning and computer vision, in particular medical applications. Currently, I am working on the *Automatic Prediction of Functional Outcome of Patients with Ischaemic Stroke*.

I obtained M.S. in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Edinburgh and B.S. in Computer Engineering at Istanbul University. 
I am gratefully funded by Turkish Republic Ministry of Education, higher education scholarship (YLSY).
