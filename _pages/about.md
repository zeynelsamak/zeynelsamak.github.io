I am a Lecturer in the [Department of Computer Engineering](https://muhendislik.adiyaman.edu.tr/tr/bolumler/bilgisayar-muhendisligi-bolumu){:target="\_blank"}  at Adıyaman University. I completed my Ph.D. in 2023 at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/){:target="\_blank"} where I was a member of [MaVi](https://uob-mavi.github.io){:target="\_blank"}, under the supervision of [Prof Majid Mirmehdi](http://people.cs.bris.ac.uk/~majid//){:target="\_blank"} and [Dr Philip Clatworthy](http://www.bris.ac.uk/clinical-sciences/people/231094/overview.html){:target="\_blank"}. My research focused on ["Automatic Prediction of Functional Outcome of Patients with Ischaemic Stroke"](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/studentTheses/automatic-prediction-of-functional-outcome-of-patients-with-ischa){:target="\_blank"}.

Before my Ph.D., I obtained MSc in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Edinburgh and BSc in Computer Engineering at Istanbul University. 

My research interests lie in the intersection of machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision, particularly with applications in the medical domain.

<!-- I am a recent PhD graduate in Computer Science from the University of Bristol, where I was a member of [Visual Information Laboratory](https://vilab.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/){:target="\_blank"}. My research was supervised by [Prof Majid Mirmehdi](http://people.cs.bris.ac.uk/~majid//){:target="\_blank"} and [Dr Philip Clatworthy](http://www.bris.ac.uk/clinical-sciences/people/231094/overview.html){:target="\_blank"}. I am interested in the machine (deep) learning and computer vision, in particular medical applications. My PhD thesis was titled *Automatic Prediction of Functional Outcome of Patients with Ischaemic Stroke*.

I obtained M.S. in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Edinburgh and B.S. in Computer Engineering at Istanbul University. 
I am gratefully funded by Turkish Republic Ministry of Education, higher education scholarship (YLSY). -->
